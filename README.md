- 👋 Hi, I’m Davide Melozzi

- 👀 I’m interested in the Naval Architecture sector, in particular aspects concerning [Yacht Design](https://github.com/davidemelozzi/Design-of-a-36-feet-Flybridge-Motor-Yacht.git), [CFD](https://github.com/davidemelozzi/Hydrodynamics-of-floating-bodies.git), [Structures](https://github.com/davidemelozzi/Design-of-Ship-Structures.git) and [Composite Materials](https://github.com/davidemelozzi/Ship-in-Composite-Materials-Yacht-Analysis.git).

- 🌱 I’m currently studying in a Master of Science program at the Technical University of Lisbon, in Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering. Starting from september I will be an exchange student at Technical University of Delft for my last year of master.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with companies for my Master's thesis project, in order to explore research and development issues at a practical level applicable to real work contexts. For this reason, I have decided to share the total work done in my first year of my master's degree, in order to denote the professional and technical skills developed in the work of the projects belonging to all the study subjects encountered.
