 👋 Hi, I’m Davide Melozzi

- 👀 I’m interested in the Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering industry, in particular aspects concerning [Yacht Design](https://github.com/davidemelozzi/Design-of-a-36-feet-Flybridge-Motor-Yacht.git), [CFD](https://github.com/davidemelozzi/Hydrodynamics-of-floating-bodies.git), [Structures](https://github.com/davidemelozzi/Design-of-Ship-Structures.git) and [Composite Materials](https://github.com/davidemelozzi/Ship-in-Composite-Materials-Yacht-Analysis.git).

- 🌱 I’m currently studying in a Master of Science program at the Technical University of Lisbon, in Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering. I participated in an exchange programme in my master final year at the Faculty of Marine Technology at the Technical University of Delft. This experience allowed me to get involved in the prestigious Dutch working world, leading me to develop my master's thesis within one of the country's best marine technology companies.  

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with companies for my professional growth, in order to explore research and development issues at a practical level applicable to real work contexts. For this reason, I have decided to share the total work done in both academi years of my master's degree, in order to denote the professional and technical skills developed in the work of the projects belonging to all the study subjects encountered.
